### Links👩🏾‍💻

## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by marking out initial structure, classes, and id's in HTML. Next I finalized the UI by styling the CSS.  I then added functionality by way of JavaScript to write the text one letter at a time and vary the speed.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned the logic behind making a simple auto text effect. I will be applying this to future projects where needed.

### Continued development🔮

I also plan on continuing to practice using event listeners to make my pages more functional.

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

```js
function writeText() {
    textEl.innerText = text.slice(0, idx)

    idx++

    if (idx > text.length) {
        idx = 1
    }

    setTimeout(writeText, speed)
}

speedEl.addEventListener('input', (e) => speed = 300 / e.target.value)
```

### Useful resources📖

- [Resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) - This is an amazing article which helped me write better commit messages. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
